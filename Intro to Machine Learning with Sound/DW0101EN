Intro to Machine Learning with Sound

Learning objectives
In this course, we use IBM Watson Studio to build classification models to predict (identify) 
animal sounds and use IBM Watson Visual Recognition to identify images of those animals; 
learn how best to gather and prepare data, create and deploy models, deploy and test a 
signal processing application, create models with binary and multiclass classifications, 
and display the predictions on a web page created by using Node-RED.

- Prepare data so that it can be consumed by machine learning models
- Build a binary classification model that can predict which animal (dogs and cats) is making a specific sound
- Build a multiclass classification model to detect whether a birdsong is from a bird from a specific order and view the confidence level of that prediction
- Make predictions on audio files by using a Node-RED application built as a web page
- Create an application in Node-RED that integrates the Watson Visual Recognition service with your machine learning model to recognize images of cats and dogs
