Using IBM Watson Studio to create and run a machine learning model.

Data File: sounds.csv
Predictor: COLUMN1 (strings: cats or dogs)
Features: all other columns

Model Technique: Binary Classification because the model is identifying cats and dogs only.

Validation split at 60, 20, 20 (60% to train the models, 20% to test the models, 
and 20% as a check of the better performing models to detect overfitting.)

Estimators evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,
Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier

Output of the models:
