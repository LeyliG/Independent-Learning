"""
Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples:

number([]) # => []
number(["a", "b", "c"]) # => ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
"""

# Python code
def number(lines):    
    out = []
    if lines == []:
        return(lines)
    else:
        for i in lines:
            out += (str(i) + ": " + lines[i])
        
    return(out)
    
# Sample Tests
test.assert_equals(number([]), [])
test.assert_equals(number(["a", "b", "c"]), ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"])
