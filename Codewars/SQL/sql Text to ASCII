/* 
Given a demographics table in the following format:

** demographics table schema **

id

birthday
race
you need to return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed to the ascii code of their first byte.

e.g. Verlie = 86 Warren = 87 Horace = 72 Tracy = 84

-- ASCII() returns the ASCII code value of the leftmost character of a character expression. -- 

SELECT id, ASCII(name) AS name, birthday, ASCII(race) AS race
FROM demographics;
