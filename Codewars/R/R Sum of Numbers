'''
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of 
all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

# R code
get_sum <- function(a, b){
  sum = 0 
  if(a == b){
    return(a)
  } else {    
      for(i in min(a,b):max(a,b)){
