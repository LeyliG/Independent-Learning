Probability that Alice will accidentally drop her phone to ground is p. 
She will not be careful after any no.of unfortunate events. 
Let X be the random variable that equals to the no.of times Alice drops her phone.

Write a program to calculate the expectation value, E(X).

Input constraints:
p in [0,1]

Input format:
First line: p

Output format:
E(X)

'''




# My code here
p = float(input())
r = p/((1-p)**2)    
print(format(r, '.6f'))
