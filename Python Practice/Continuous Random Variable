Alice has to wait for her husband at the station and X denotes the times elapsed before he arrives. 
If given that X is exponentially distributed with lambda = 0.01, what is the probability 
that Alice has to wait for more than N mins P(X>=N).

Input constraints:
N>=0

Input format:
First line: N

Output format:
Probability of waiting for N minutes, rounded up to six decimal places.

# My code here

# import math package to use exp() function to use e
import math

N = int(input())
lambdas = 0.01

# Note: for the Exponential distribution P(X <= N) = 1 - e ^(-lambda*N)
# Then, P(x >= N) = 1 - P(X <= N) = e ^(-lambda*N)

p = math.exp(-lambdas*N)
print(format(p, '.6f'))
