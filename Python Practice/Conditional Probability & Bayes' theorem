'''

Bob has an important meeting tomorrow and he has to reach office on time in morning. 
His general mode of transport is by car and on a regular day (no car trouble) 
the probability that he will reach on time is p_ot. The probability that he might 
have car trouble is p_ct. If the car runs into trouble he will have to take a 
train and only 2 trains out of the available N trains will get him to office on time.

What are the chances that he will reach office on time tomorrow?

Input constraints:
all probabilities in [0,1] interval and N >= 2


Input format:

First line: p_ct
Second line: p_ot
Third line: N

Output format:
Probability he will reach in time, rounded to six decimal digits

# Write your code here
p_ct = float(input())
p_ot = float(input())
N = int(input())

# p_ot = p(OT| no CT)*P(no CT) + p_ct*p(take train)
#      = p_ot * (1 - P_ct) + p_ct * (2/N)

p = p_ot*(1 - p_ct) + p_ct*(2/N)
p = format(p, '.6f')
print(p)
